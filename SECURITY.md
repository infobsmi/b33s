# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We always provide security updates for the [latest release](https://github.com/infobsmi/b33s/releases/latest).
Whenever there is a security update you just need to upgrade to the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

All security bugs in [b33s](https://github,com/infobsmi/b33s) (or other b33s/* repositories)
should be reported by email to security@min.io. Your email will be acknowledged within 48 hours,
and you'll receive a more detailed response to your email within 72 hours indicating the next steps
in handling your report.

Please, provide a detailed explanation of the issue. In particular, outline the type of the security
issue (DoS, authentication bypass, information disclose, ...) and the assumptions you're making (e.g. do
you need access credentials for a successful exploit).


### Disclosure Process

b33s uses the following disclosure process:

1. Once the security report is received one member of the security team tries to verify and reproduce
   the issue and determines the impact it has.
2. A member of the security team will respond and either confirm or reject the security report.
   If the report is rejected the response explains why.
3. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
4. Fixes are prepared for the latest release.


This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required with maintainers of other projects.
Every effort will be made to handle the bug in as timely a manner as possible, however it's important that we
follow the process described above to ensure that disclosures are handled consistently.
